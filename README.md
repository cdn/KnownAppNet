App.net Support for Known
==========================

This plugin provides App.net syndication (POSSE) support for Known articles and status updates.

It provides basic status update and long post syndication; currently more advanced features (file uploads, starring etc) are not supported,
but as always, pull requests are welcome.

Installation
------------

* Drop the App.net folder into the IndoPlugins folder of your idno installation.
* Log into known and click on Administration.
* Click "install" on the plugins page
* Enter your oauth details, then users will be able to link their accounts

TODO
----

* [ ] Image (and other media) upload via attachments, perhaps using my oEmbed plugin
* [ ] Links / canonical urls for long posts don't appear to do anything, although I might have got something wrong. Pull requests accepted! :)
